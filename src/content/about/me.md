I am a PhD student at E칬tv칬s Lor치nd University researching Machine Unlearning, with **three** years of experience working with **Deep Neural Networks**, **Machine Learning**, and **Reinforcement Learning**. I am also knowledgeable in MLOps, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Graph Neural Networks. Additionally, I am an instructor at the university, teaching two master's classes in the Department of Artificial Intelligence: Deep Network Development and Collective Intelligence.

I often participate in online hackathons and Kaggle competitions. My current research focuses on **scalability in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning**, as well as **Machine Unlearning** and its applications in Reinforcement Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Complex Systems. I am passionate and resilient in my work.

I am also a staff researcher working on the project [APOLLO2028](https://www.apollo-2028.eu/), which is funded by the EU.

Looking ahead, I am excited to complete my **PhD program**. My goal is to become an expert in transforming complex data challenges into practical, deployable, and impactful software solutions for real-world applications.

I also like bouldering. A lot.
