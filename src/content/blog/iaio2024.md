description: Following the event in Bulgaria, a new international competition emerged, hosted by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. As new participants, we were welcomed with the same remarkable generosity as in the previous event. While the competition topics largely remained the same, math problems and reinforcement learning were added. The event is taking place in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia and one of the country’s most advanced financial hubs.

# <u>International Artificial Intelligence Olympiad (IAIO) 2024</u>

<hr class="border-1 border-t border-tcotta dark:border-dark-tcotta my-0" />

After missing the opportunity to attend the Olympiad in Burgas, I’m deeply honored to have been chosen as a <span class="font-extrabold">deputy leader</span> for the IAIO 2024, which will be held in <span class="font-extrabold">Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia</span>. The hospitality and support from the event organizers have been exceptional, assisting everyone with visa options, travel arrangements, and insurance well in advance. The webinars and preparation materials provided have been invaluable in helping students gear up for this international event.

With the recent inclusion of Reinforcement Learning in the Olympiad curriculum, I’ve had the opportunity of guiding students through fundamental RL concepts, from Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) to Deep Q Networks. <span class="font-extrabold">This is an incredible opportunity for me to travel and experience a completely new country, immersed in its rich history and vibrant culture.</span> [<span class="font-extrabold text-tcotta dark:text-dark-tcotta ">[IAIO 2024]</span>](https://www.iaio-official.org/)

## <u>The Olympiad</u>

What an unforgettable journey. I’m still struggling to find the right words to describe such an  <span class="font-extrabold">extraordinary experience</span>. Saudi Arabia greeted us with genuine warmth, remarkable hospitality, and the most exceptional tour guide we could have asked for— <span class="font-extrabold text-tcotta dark:text-dark-tcotta">Ibrahim</span>.

The flight was very comfortable, and Turkish Airlines maintained a <span class="font-extrabold">high standard of professionalism throughout</span>, ensuring smooth connections, efficient handling of luggage, excellent in-flight meals, and overall comfort. The flight was so enjoyable that time seemed to pass effortlessly. The breathtaking views, especially over the pyramids of Cairo and the vast Saudi desert, only added to the experience.

We were greeted by our tour guide holding the Hungarian flag, which was a heartwarming surprise. We were then taken to the <span class="font-extrabold text-tcotta dark:text-dark-tcotta">Narcissus Hotel</span> in the center of Riyadh, showcasing some of the most impressive architecture I’ve ever seen, with stunning details, exceptional build quality, and unparalleled comfort. Upon arriving in my spacious single room, I was welcomed with an <span class="font-extrabold">incredible branded gift from the organizers</span>, which included a traditional Saudi Dallah (coffee maker), coffee pots, and Bukhoor (incense)—a very memorable gesture.

## <u>Al-Diriyah</u>

The welcome we received was exceptionally warm, allowing us to immerse ourselves in various aspects of Saudi culture. We were treated to <span class="font-extrabold">traditional Saudi music </span>and a short video showcasing the country’s values and heritage. As delegation leaders and deputies, we were given the option to visit </span> [<span class="font-extrabold text-tcotta dark:text-dark-tcotta">[Al-Diriyah]</span>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diriyah), a UNESCO World Heritage site and the original seat of the Saudi royal family, as well as the old town of Riyadh. The site has been meticulously preserved, with historical structures carefully reinforced for long-term conservation. We also had the chance to explore the rich history of Saudi Arabia and the story of how the nation came into being. One particular artifact that stood out to me was the traditional weapon, known as the <span class="font-extrabold">Al-Adhaimah</span> (العجرمة), historically passed down among the rulers of Saudi Arabia.

The weather was, to say the least, unconventional. As Europeans, we are not accustomed to temperatures well above 40°C. The most challenging aspect was not just the heat, but the <span class="font-extrabold">wind—small gusts</span> that, instead of providing relief, felt intensely hot, making the temperature feel even more oppressive. However, due to the dry climate typical of Saudi Arabia, the heat was somewhat more bearable than the numbers on the weather app might suggest. This <span class="font-extrabold">made the city come to life during the night</span>, when the sun had fully set, and the cooler air made the streets much more vibrant and enjoyable.

## <u>General Assembly</u>

As a member of the General Assembly, my responsibilities included tasks related to the ongoing Olympiad, such as marking, translating, and cross-checking results. Despite averaging only four hours of sleep per night for five consecutive days, I found the experience <span class="font-extrabold">immensely fulfilling and would gladly do it all over again</span> without hesitation. The representatives from all the participating countries were not only professional but also a pleasure to engage with—collaborative, enthusiastic, and united in their efforts to improve the Olympiad for future students. Working alongside such brilliant and dedicated minds was a true honor and created a highly motivating atmosphere for me.

## <u>Friends that Last</u>

I would like to express my deepest gratitude to our guide, <span class="font-extrabold text-tcotta dark:text-dark-tcotta">Ibrahim</span>. He truly made us fall in love with Saudi Arabia and its people. He introduced us to breathtaking views, unforgettable meals (including my first taste of authentic Arabic <span class="font-extrabold">shawarma</span>), thoughtful gifts, and most importantly, the warmth and hospitality of the Saudi culture. Through his eyes, I felt like I could truly see Saudi Arabia, appreciating both its remarkable strengths and the challenges the country is still working to overcome.

<hr class="border-1 border-t border-tcotta dark:border-dark-tcotta my-0" />

I also want to extend my heartfelt thanks to <span class="font-extrabold">all the men and women on the organizing team</span> for their kindness and patience toward every participant. Managing 25 different countries, cultures, and customs simultaneously, while staying true to your own, must have been no small feat. Your hard work and dedication were evident, and it will be extremely difficult to surpass the level of hospitality and determination you displayed in future events. The branding of the event was exceptional as well, and I believe it plays a significant role in promoting both the Olympiad and the country for future recognition.

## <u>GAIN</u>

I would also like to extend my gratitude to the <span class="font-extrabold text-tcotta dark:text-dark-tcotta">GAIN organizers</span> for hosting us in such a beautiful setting. I sincerely hope our paths cross again in the future. We returned home with an incredible achievement: 1 gold, 2 silver, and 1 bronze medal, with all four of our students earning medals and Team Hungary ranked as the second-best overall country. I am immensely proud of you, <span class="font-extrabold text-tcotta dark:text-dark-tcotta">Benedek, Balázs, Vince, and Miranda</span>. I had an amazing time with you and will surely miss you all. Thank you for your strength and resilience throughout this less-than-perfect Olympiad, while still managing to stay focused on the task at hand.

## <u>The End</u>

There are many things that will stay with me from this experience:

- **Men having waiting times in bathrooms** (but the toilets are much cleaner and more hygienic than anywhere in Europe—please adopt this!).
- The **thawb (ثوب)** is incredibly comfortable and provides great protection against the scorching sun.
- The **abaya (عباءة)** worn by women comes in a stunning variety of styles, with intricate embroideries and designs, while even the **niqab (نقاب)** is accessorized with beautifully designed pins to hold the fabric together.
- I also observed that **women’s warm personalities** often shine through their accessories, demeanor, or the unique variations in their traditional dresses.
- The **level of respect between people** is notably higher than in the Western world.
- **Cleanliness is evident everywhere**, and everyone we encountered was generally smiling and wonderful to be around.

I'm deeply hoping to return and spend more time truly exploring, not just the heart of the capital but also the historical and less touristy parts of the country. <span class="font-extrabold text-tcotta dark:text-dark-tcotta">Thank you, Saudi Arabia, for hosting Team Hungary</span>.

<p style="text-align: right; direction: rtl;">
    شكرًا جزيلًا لك يا السعودية على كرم الضيافة. أتمنى أن أعود قريبًا لاستكشاف المزيد من جمال بلدك.
