# <u>Deep Reinforcement Learning</u>

**2024/25/2**

This is a collection of notes and practice materials I have developed for the **Deep Reinforcement** Learning course, where I serve as a substitute practice lecturer. Most of the materials have already been created, and I am currently filling in the remaining gaps. I plan to make these resources publicly available to ensure that students can easily access them both during the course and in the future.

Please note that the materials may contain small mistakes, typos, or even implementation bugs. I would appreciate any notifications about these issues sent to my [email](mailto:tamastheactual%40inf.elte.hu?subject=Issues%20with%20course%20material%20DND).

### Description


This course is designed to provide students with a comprehensive introduction to **Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)**. Students will explore fundamental RL concepts, including **agents, environments, policies, rewards, value functions**, and decision-making under uncertainty.

Participants will learn a variety of foundational topics, such as **Multi-Armed Bandits, Bellman Equations, Dynamic Programming (Policy Evaluation, Policy Improvement, and Policy Iteration), Monte Carlo Prediction and Control, Temporal-Difference Learning (including TD(0), SARSA, and Q-Learning), and Eligibility Traces**. The course will also cover distinctions between model-free and model-based methods and their applications.

Building on these fundamentals, students will delve into Deep RL techniques, including Function Approximation, **Deep Q-Networks (DQN)**, and Policy Gradient Methods such as **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Actor-Critic methods**. Practical components will include hands-on implementation using PyTorch, focusing on building, training, and debugging RL agents in simulated environments.

The course also emphasizes essential practical topics, such as **exploration strategies** (e.g., epsilon-greedy and softmax), reward design, and managing trade-offs between exploration and exploitation. By the end of the course, students will have developed a strong theoretical foundation and practical skills to apply RL techniques to a wide range of real-world and simulated problems.

### Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of Python programming.
- Familiarity with machine learning concepts.
- Prior exposure to neural networks (recommended but not required).

### Tools and Frameworks
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Frameworks**: PyTorch, TorchRL
- **Libraries**: Gymnasium, TorchRL, OpenAI Baselines, NumPy
- **Additional Tools**: Google Colab

### Learning Objectives

- Understand the foundational concepts of Reinforcement Learning and Deep Reinforcement Learning.
- Implement and train RL and DRL algorithms to solve practical problems.
- Gain hands-on experience using PyTorch and TorchRL for creating, debugging, and optimizing RL systems.
