# <u>Collective Intelligence</u>

I have compiled all the practice materials for the **Collective Intelligence** course, which I teach alongside my PhD colleague, Zoltán Barta, at Eötvös Loránd University. The course materials for practical work are still in development and relatively minimal at this stage. However, I would like to make these resources publicly available so that students can easily access them during the course and afterward.

Please note that the materials may contain small mistakes, typos, or even implementation bugs. I would appreciate any notifications about these issues sent to my [email](mailto:tamastheactual%40inf.elte.hu?subject=Issues%20with%20course%20material%20DND).

## <u> Exams </u>

The grade is determined by the results of two assignments, which together create a composite grade. Additionally, to receive this grade, students must pass an exam based on the lecture material. These exams are administered by the Course Owner, László Gulyás. Here are some examples of the exams:

- <a href="exam/1.pdf" target="_blank" style="display: inline-flex; align-items: center; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 5px;"><img src="pdf.png" alt="Open PowerPoint" style="width: 15px; height: auto; margin-right: 5px;" /><strong><u>1. Exam</u></strong></a>

### Schedule

- Practice: Unknown
- Location: Unknown

### Description

This course is designed to provide students with an in-depth exploration of topics related to Collective Intelligence. Students will learn about agents, agent-based systems, and **Multi-Agent Systems**, along with their relevance to real-life dynamics and systems.  

Participants will gain a comprehensive understanding of the **Logo programming language** and the **NetLogo software**, which will enable them to create simulations using agent-based modeling. Additionally, the course covers Game Theory, Algorithmic Game Theory, and foundational algorithms such as **Minimax Q-Learning, Nash Q-Learning, Fictitious Play, and Neural Replicator Dynamics**.

This course is designed to provide students with an in-depth exploration of **Deep Learning**, particularly
focusing on Neural Network architectures. Throughout the semester, students will gain a comprehensive
understanding of how **Deep Neural Networks** work, from the fundamental theory behind their design to
practical implementation skills. The course primarily covers **Supervised Deep Learning** techniques and
equips students with hands-on experience using PyTorch, a popular Deep Learning framework. By working
through **practices and assignments in PyTorch**, students will learn to build, train, and optimize neural
networks effectively.

Moreover, students will delve into **Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning** using the TorchRL framework. They will create simple systems utilizing the **IPPO and IDQN** algorithms to tackle toy and benchmark problems. Throughout the course, students will learn how to tune reward systems, debug multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) systems, perform environment transformations, and implement feature extractor networks.
